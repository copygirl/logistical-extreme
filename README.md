# Create: Logistical Extreme

This modpack aims to encourage players to build logistics between different parts of the world. Whether vehicles on roads, trains on tracks, or planes through the sky, you'll be forced to use new means of transport, because not only are resources spread far out in the world, requiring you to travel, but also we're massively reducing the stack size of items, so your player inventory alone will no longer be enough to carry everything.

The foundational mods in this pack are:
- **[Create]**: Kind of obvious. The basis of automation and creation.
- **[Valkyrien Skies]**: Physical creations made of blocks, separate from the world.
- **[Clockwork]**: Content bridge between VS and Create. Also, planes!
- **[Trackwork]**: Adds tracks and wheels, for vehicles.
- **[Large Ore Deposits]**: Configured for rare, massive ore veins you'll dig out for days.
- **[Dynamic Trees]**: Not only are these trees pretty, but also no more easy charcoal automation!
- **[Distant Horizons]**: With massive worlds you'll be needing massive view distances.
- **[Peaceful Nights]**: Enjoy building on the surface without pesky creepers getting in the way.

Additionally, there will be many more content mods for you to explore, and many tweaks and custom recipes that will make the experience unique from your usual Minecraft modpack. Are you ready? We know we aren't.
